*Research and Development bootcamp supported by [NYC ASCENT.](http://www.nycascent.org/){:target="_blank"}*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
EDS bootcamp is designed to bring PhD level researchers up to speed in the modern field of Data Science. The curriculum is formed based on the tolls and practices currently in use in data driven businesses and industry. It is meant to cover a wide spectrum of data science sufficient to start producing meaningful results. Theory and practice are interconnected to enhance hands-on experience on real-life data sets. The knowledge will helps researchers to move their project and/or entrepreneurial interests forward to areas where other methods are cumbersome. At the same time it prepares the participants for transition to industry should they choose a career outside Academia. References to common industry practices will be given and invited guests from fields such as finance, consulting and start-ups will give insights to common practices.

## Throughout the course the participants work in:


  * __descriptive and predictive modeling__   
  linear models, trees, random forest; exploiting bootstrap and cross-validation; Students are exposed to modeling on cluster using SparkR and H2O.    
  * __munging highly unstructured data__     
  data located on local computer, SQL data base, or Hadoop cluster via SparkR. This includes cleaning, restructuring, reduction of dimensionality, and organizing data sets for subsequent tasks. 
   * __text analytics__    
  bag of words, feature engineering and predictive modeling.
  * __presentation tools__    
  creating professional plots, dynamically updated reports and slides. 
  * __deployment of the analytics findings__  
  as a web application (R Shiny)
  
**Main tools, libraries and algorithms:**   R Studio, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, sparkR, H2O, tm package, R Markdown, Shiny, caret package, Git.
