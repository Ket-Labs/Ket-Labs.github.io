Essentials of Data Science (EDS) training is designed to bring PhD level researchers up to speed in the modern field of Data Science. The curriculum is formed based on the tools and practices currently in use in data driven businesses and industry. It is meant to cover a wide spectrum of data science sufficient to start producing meaningful results. Theory and practice are interconnected to enhance hands-on experience on real-life data sets. The knowledge will help researchers to move their project and/or entrepreneurial interests forward to areas where other methods are cumbersome. At the same time, it prepares the participants for transition to industry should they choose a career outside Academia. References to common industry practices will be given and invited guests from fields such as finance, consulting and start-ups will give insights to common practices.
