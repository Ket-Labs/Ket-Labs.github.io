You can find a lot of study materials about R and data science all over the internet. Here we highlight the essentials which would help you to start doing the job you have to do, figuring out details on the way.

## Books

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), by Garrett Grolemund, Hadley Wickham
* [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](http://ggplot2.org/book/) by Hadley Wickham
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani

## Cheatsheets

* [dplyr and tidyr](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)
* [ggplot](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)
* [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/images/shiny-cheatsheet.pdf)

## SQL
* [Using dplyr formulated operations to run them on SQL server](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/databases.html)
* [Generating SQL queries from dplyr](http://spark.rstudio.com/dplyr.html#sql_translation)

## Parallel processing in R 
* Microsoft R Open & MKL (https://mran.microsoft.com/download/) - seamless use of more than one cpu core

## Working with Big data (located in cluster)
* sparklyr: [R interface for Apache Spark](http://spark.rstudio.com/index.html) 
* rsparkling: [Sparkling Water (H2O) Machine Learning, including deep learning](http://spark.rstudio.com/h2o.html)
* [R with Hadoop](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/06/using-hadoop-with-r-it-depends.html)
* [Visualize Large Data](http://spark.rstudio.com/taxiDemoH2O.nb.html#visualize) 

## Plotting libraries
* ggplot - see [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* [plotly](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/) - making ggplot2 interactive
* [ggvis](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/0.1/ggvis-basics.html) - interactive plots (Behind the scenes, interactive plots are built with shiny, and you can currently only have one running at a time in a given R session)
* [dygraph](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/) - R interface to the dygraphs JavaScript charting library. It provides rich facilities for charting time-series data in R
