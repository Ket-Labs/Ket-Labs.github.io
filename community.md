Ket Labs is a growing community of professionals, scientists, and PhD students devoted to facilitate exchange of ideas between academia and industry. It is coordinated by Dr. Sergey Samsonau and supported by contributors and participants from various fields. At Ket Labs we are actively looking for new fields where modern data science methods can be applied and reveal results which otherwise cannot be achieved. We work closely with research institutions and data driven companies in order to make sure we use the modern solutions for data analytic needs.

## Contributors

We welcome contributors from Industry and Academia. Some ideas can be covered by our previous students, who by now obtained new unique experience. Such contribution serves well to facilitate flow of ideas and knowlege. 

**Special recognition goes to the efforts of the following people:**    

_Denis Sharoukhov, PhD_       

Denis is working on image analysis of neuronal fiber bundles for his thesis work. He is utilizing open source programming on daily basis to extract patterns hidden in large data-sets. Image processing, statistical modeling, trend discovery and classification of data are the main components of his research.

## Network of domain knowledge advisers
We benefit a lot from having participants being specialists in various fields: current and recent PhD students, Postdocs, and working professionals from CUNY, Columbia, NYU, and others

Participants implement projects in their field of expertise (domain) and if they wish, they become a part of a growing network of advisers, who can help you with an advice related to their field. At this moment, we can connect our future students to specialists working in:

+ Nanoscience
+ Spectroscopy
+ Signal analysis
+ Medicine
+ Psychology
+ Neurobiology
+ Oceanography
+ Optical networks
+ Data Bases
+ Analysis of terrorist attack activity
+ Data Science for Gamers
+ Text analytics
+ Stock market analysis
