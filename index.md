__Ket Labs is a peer based Research Laboratory created to promote the use of modern data science tools in traditional research.__ 

## We work with researchers from various fields to help them:

* Optimize data workflow in research projects using modern tools.   
R allows to streamline otherwise tedious tasks.

* Open new directions in the projects

* Implement a project based on an existing domain knowledge in a "non-science" area

* Enable researchers to implement their ideas in a form that can be easily shared with others.    
We employ the power of open-source

* Look into the world of industry and prepare for transition should they choose to do so.    
_Companies are constantly looking for talent with deep domain expertise who can carry out data science projects using open source technologies._
