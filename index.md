__Ket Labs is devoted to promote the use of modern data science tools in traditional research.__ 

### We work with researchers from various fields to help them:

* Optimize data workflow in research projects using modern tools.   
R language allows to streamline otherwise tedious tasks.

* Open new directions in the projects.

* Implement a project based on an existing domain knowledge in a "non-science" area.

* Enable researchers to implement their ideas in a form that can be easily shared with others.    
We employ the power of open-source.

* Look into the world of industry and prepare for transition should they choose to do so.    
    - Using modern tools to carry out and communicate a research allows to obtain experience recognized by industry.
    - Open source technologies, in particular R, is a desired skill in a potential employee.
    - Understanding the type of work conducted in industry helps prepare for a transition.
