__Ket Labs is devoted to promote the use of modern data science tools in traditional research.__ 

* In most cases PhD-students and Post-docs can work with the data they collect and learn the tools needed in industry at the same time

* Data Science methods provide a unified way for handling data, being collected from a spectrometer, a street survey, presented as a text or images, and another source

* Learning to use a free versatile tool (widely employed in industry) to handle different data types simplifies a transition and collaboration between fields and from academia to industry

* Implementing a project in R language allows a researcher to share results in a reproducible form, and at the same time develops skills industry desires

## What do we do

* We work with specialists from industry to identify the "essentials" every data scientist should know

* At "Essential of Data Science" training we teach students to use R for handling different types of data and apply machine learning techniques. We discuss the typical projects in industry. The training is supported by [Pivigo](https://www.pivigo.com/){:target="_blank"}

* We provide continued support for a project development after EDS training

* Many of our students landed on Data Science positions after finishing their academic carrier or extended their training by participating in such programs as [S2DS bootcamp](http://www.s2ds.org/){:target="_blank"} organized by our partner [Pivigo](https://www.pivigo.com/){:target="_blank"} or [Insight](http://insightdatascience.com/){:target="_blank"}.
