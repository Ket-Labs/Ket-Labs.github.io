Work with project traking drifters (...), involves a lot of computations. One of EDS participants has a code implemented in MATLAB. Implementing data exploration and reformating in R allowed him to create a new type of visualization. Sharing an interactive appliation using R shiny has a potential in simplifying communication with collaborators. Having code writen in open source language allowes collaborators to participate in development without any cost associated with purchasing a licese for a commertial software.

Exploration of efficiency of dynamic distribution of power in fiber optics cables was performed in R to visualize and understand data. Optimization algorithm was developed and published online on GitHub for other scientist to be able to reproduce results and improve the code farther.

Research in medical field includes a lot of statistics. However use of user interface based programs like Statistica limits flexibility and reproducibility of research by other scientists. We were participating in implementating part of data analysis and visualization using R. The results are published in a peer-review journal.

FIB
We are participating in a project involving semi-automatic analysis of images produces by Focused Ion Beam, aiming to exctract information about characteristics of FIB operation.
