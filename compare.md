title: Compare EDS to other programs
permalink: /compare/
---

Let us highlight the main ways to learn Data Science:    
* Get Master degree offered by Berkley, Columbia and other universities. However, as PhD (or PhD student) you are unlikely to be motivated and have time/money to get another Masters degree.
* Use online classes offered by Coursera, DataCamp and other websites. Though these classes are great, they usually are quite general, and are not tuned for specific auditory and goal.
* Onsite trainings and bootcamps.    
If your goal is to get a DS job, we recommend one of the following pathways:
    + 35-hour program -> DS job
    + 35-hour program -> 5-7 weeks Bootcamp -> DS job
    + 12 weeks bootcamp

## Why the price is so low?

EDS training is a non-profit initiative of Ket Labs. We believe those who spend so much time to contribute to science and society deserve help in transition to industry. And this help should be as affordable as possible. The cost of the program helps us to cover the expenses and working hours without any overhead for profit.

Some say USA produces too many PhDs. At Ket Labs we say, our society did not learn yet how to leverage this great potential!
